Please download Deepfish Dataset from this link:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/deep-fish-object-detection  
The origin Deep Fish dataset, hosted on Kaggle, is in YOLO (You Only Look Once) format, and we have unified the annotation format by converting it to COCO format.You can directly use it in the annotations directory.  
However, you still need to organize the original images into the following structure:  
```
├──Deepfish  
    ├──train   
    ├──val  
    ...
```
